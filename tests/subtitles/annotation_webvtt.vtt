00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.230
You have a lot of audio and video content that you

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.333
want to Even if you have it <c.1>organized</c>, it's often hard for

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:13.500
people to find exactly what they're looking for. It'd be nice if

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.769
people could search audiovisual content in the same way that they search across

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:22.076
and through <c.2>text documents</c>, it's almost as if your audio and video files are

00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:26.076
stranded separated from other content, it simply doesn't feel like they are being

00:00:26.076 --> 00:00:30.600
used to their fullest potential. Enter <c.3>Aviary</c>. A platform

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.666
for sharing, searching, and navigating audiovisual content in

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:38.769
a totally new way. You can search across all content

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:43.000
in Aviary using keywords and phrases, use facets to filter results,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.090
using dates, locations, languages and more. And Aviary displays

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.333
and searches audiovisual content with fully synchronized transcripts,

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:55.727
indexes, and <c.4>annotations</c>, offering direct access to key points

00:00:55.727 --> 00:00:59.818
in an audiovisual timeline. Organizations can sync, import or upload

00:00:59.818 --> 00:01:04.000
their audiovisual collections directly into the Aviary platform, and they can adjust permissions to

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.181
each item to ensure access is available for intended audiences. With

00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:12.250
